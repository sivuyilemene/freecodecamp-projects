    <h3> Timeline of Itachi's life </h3>
    
    <p>
      Itachi Uchiha was a ninja of The Hidden Leaf Village's Uchiha clan, that served as an Anbu Captain. He later became an international  criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international rogue ninja criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with The Leaf and its ninja — including Sasuke — who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of The Leaf to the very end
    </p>
<ul>
  <li>Born to Mikoto and Fugaka Uchia</li>
  <br>
  <li>Age 4 - The Third Great Ninja War begins. The death and destruction of the war made him a pacifist </li>
   <br>
  <li>Age 5 - Become a big brother to Sasuke. The Nine Tailed Fox Best attacks the village and Leaf Village leaders believing that the Uchiha clan were responsible for the attack, resulting in relations souring between the two. The Uchiha were relocated to the edge of the village, isolating them from the rest of the village and making it easier to monitor them </li>
   <br>
  <li>Age 6 - Itachi enrolled into the Academy where he consistently scored the highest in each subject and quickly learned any skill taught to him, After four months, his teachers unanimously agreed let him take the graduation exam early due to Itachi being more than advanced enough to passed for genin-level, which he passed</li>
   <br>
  <li>Itachi went on to honing his skills to chūnin level, leading to him drawing the attention of Leaf's leaders. Meeting the criteria, Fugaku(father) allowed him to sit in on clan meetings in the Naka Shrine basement.Nearly a year since graduating, Itachi had mastered ninjutsu to the extent his missions went too easy</li>
  <br>
  <li>Age 8 - Awakend his Sharingan, which he mastered at the same age</li>
  <br>
  <li>Age 11 - He entered the Anbu.Itachi's accomplishments were a source of great pride for his family, his father viewing him as proof of the Uchiha's future prosperity and his brother viewing him as a model to live up to.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Eventually, the Uchiha's disdain for their unfair treatment led them to plan a coup d'état. Fugaku, head of the Uchiha and the coup's chief conspirator, encouraged Itachi's advancement into the Anbu's ranks as a means of spying on the village. Itachi, however, knew an Uchiha coup would lead to intervention from other villages and ultimately start another World War, something he could not support. He instead became a double agent, reporting the Uchiha's actions to the Third Hokage and the Leaf Village Council in the hopes it would help them find a peaceful resolution</li>
  <br>
  <li>Age 13 -  He was promoted to Anbu captain.Although the Third Hokage still wished to negotiate with the Uchiha, Danzō Shimura recognised that there was no longer an outcome that could see the Uchiha clan's survival. He explained this to Itachi and left him a choice: support the Uchiha's coup and have the whole clan, including Sasuke, killed in the ensuing conflict, or accept the assignment to wipe out the clan before the coup started and be allowed to spare Sasuke. Itachi chose his brother.</li>
  <br>
  <li>In one night Itachi and Tobi slaughtered the entire clan. Itachi took it upon himself to personally execute his parents. Despite his betrayal, they bore him no ill-will, instead telling him in the moments before they were killed that they were proud of him and requesting that he take care of Sasuke.Racked by grief for his actions, Itachi saw in Sasuke the only person suitable to punish him for his crimes. In order to set Sasuke on this road he cast himself as the villain, done by allowing Sasuke to find him standing over their parents' bodies and using Tsukuyomi to torment him with visions of their murders. Sasuke fled, fearing his own death, but Itachi chased him down to divulge the lie he had concocted: he killed their family to test his mettle and now wanted to test himself against the only remaining challenge to him, the little brother he had never loved. He encouraged Sasuke to become strong enough to kill him and take revenge, and to that end suggested he acquire a Mangekyō Sharingan of his own.</li>
  <br>
  <li>For his final business in the village, Itachi visited the Third Hokage and reported his mission completed, much to the Third's surprise and disappointment. Itachi requested that the Third look after Sasuke, which the Third vowed to do. Itachi left the village publicly a traitor but secretly with a new mission: to infiltrate Tobi's organisation, Akatsuki, and keep it from moving against the Leaf.</li>
  <br>
  <li>At some point, Itachi contracted a terminal illness. He kept himself alive through the years with medicine and sheer willpower so that he could live long enough to die by Sasuke's hand.</li>
</ul>
